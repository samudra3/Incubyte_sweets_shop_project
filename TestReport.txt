🧪 Test Report
Project: Sweet Shop Management System

Backend API & Integration Testing

1. Objective

The objective of this test report is to present the results of automated testing performed on the Sweet Shop Management System backend.
The tests ensure correctness, security, and reliability of authentication, authorization, sweets management, and inventory operations.

2. Testing Tools & Environment

Testing Framework: Jest

HTTP Testing: Supertest

Database: MongoDB (Test Environment)

Runtime: Node.js

Environment Variables: .env.test

All tests were executed in an isolated test environment to avoid affecting production data.

3. Test Scope

The following modules were covered:

Authentication

User registration

User login

Invalid credentials handling

Authorization & Middleware

Token-based authentication

Role-based access control (User vs Admin)

Admin-only route protection

Sweets Module

Create sweet (Admin only)

List all sweets

Search sweets by name and price range

Inventory Management

Purchase sweet (quantity decrease)

Restock sweet (Admin only)

4. Test Execution Summary
Category	      TotalTests	Passed  Failed
Authentication	 4	          4	    0
Authorization	 3	          3	    0
Sweets Module	 5	          5	    0
Inventory	       2	          2	    0
Total	            14	         14	    0
5. Test Results
✔ Overall Result: PASS

All automated test cases executed successfully without any failures.

Test Suites: 8 passed, 8 total
Tests:       14 passed, 14 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        ~3 seconds

6. Key Validations

Unauthorized users are correctly blocked from protected routes.

Admin-only actions (create, restock, delete sweets) are enforced.

Inventory quantity updates correctly during purchase and restock.

Search functionality works for name and price filters.

Error handling behaves as expected for invalid inputs.

7. Testing Methodology

A fail → fix → refactor methodology was followed:

Write failing test cases first

Implement the required functionality

Refactor code while keeping tests passing

This ensured correctness and maintainability.

8. AI Usage in Testing

* AI tools were used selectively to:

Generate initial test case structures

Speed up repetitive boilerplate test writing

All generated tests were:

Manually reviewed

Modified to match real API responses

Executed and verified locally
